Hi, I'm Eddie. I build data platforms and platform engineering teams at growth-stage companies. Previously, I co-founded Civic Insight, a data analytics company. That company was acquired, and I led the integration of the products and data platform. I am now Senior Director of Engineering at ThoughtSpot Inc., where I lead the integration of our infrastructure, data platform, AI, and data science teams. 

I enjoy analyzing complex systems and am passionate about modernizing and evolving organizations. Iâ€™ve also worked extensively on open-source and open-data standards for cities and the government.

I provide advisory and fractional leadership services to Engineering and Product organizations. If you're interested in speaking, <a href="https://tidycal.com/eddietejeda/30-minute-meeting">schedule time here.</a>
