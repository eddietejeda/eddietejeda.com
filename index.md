Hi, I'm Eddie. I build data platforms and platform engineering teams at growth-stage companies. Previously, I co-founded Civic Insight, a data analytics company that was acquired, and led the integration of the product and data platform. I am now Senior Director of Engineering at ThoughtSpot Inc., where I lead the integration of our infrastructure, data platform, AI, and data science teams. 

I enjoy analyzing complex systems and am passionate about modernizing and evolving organizations. Iâ€™ve also worked extensively on open-source and open-data standards for cities and the federal government.

If you're interested in speaking with me, <a href="https://tidycal.com/eddietejeda/30-minute-meeting">schedule time here.</a>
