I bring a creative approach to solving problems. I blend technical and business skills to create sustainable and scalable systems. Iâ€™ve built high-functioning technical teams, launched large-scale applications, built trust with senior executives, and led multi-million dollar negotiations. I focus on challenges that have a positive and meaningful impact on society.
