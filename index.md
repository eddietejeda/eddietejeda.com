Hi, I'm Eddie. I build Data Platforms and Platform Engineering teams. Previously, I co-founded Civic Insight, a data analytics company. That company was acquired, and I led the integration of the Product and Data Platform. I am now Senior Director of Engineering at ThoughtSpot Inc., where I lead the integration of our Infrastructure, Data Platform, AI, and Data Science teams. 

I like to analyze complex systems and am passionate about ways to modernize and evolve organizations. Iâ€™ve worked extensively on open-source and open-data standards for cities and the federal government.

Are you interested in meeting me? <a href="https://tidycal.com/eddietejeda/30-minute-meeting">Schedule time here.</a>
