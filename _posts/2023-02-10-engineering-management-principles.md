title: Engineering Management Principles

When I work with new people, I like to be transparent about my approach so my decisions are clear from the start.

Here are a few of my engineering principles:

1. Focus on building momentum.
    * Small successes lead to larger successes.
    * Engineers perform best when they rack up wins.
    * Ship code to production often.
    * A confident team is an ambitious team.

2. Focus on small, fast decisions.
    * Good decision-making improves with practice.
    * Leaders must be comfortable acting with incomplete information.
    * When a manager is wrong, they should reflect—but not dwell. The sooner they accept reality, the sooner they can course-correct.

3. High trust and high accountability.
    * Engineering leaders should get to know what motivates each engineer.
    * It’s a manager’s job to harness an engineer’s intrinsic drive for problem-solving.
    * Regularly conduct blameless reviews of team practices.
    * If someone isn’t a good fit, don’t delay making changes to the team.
