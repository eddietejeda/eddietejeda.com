Welcome. This new section of my website is an experiment to catalog ideas I've explored throughout my career building teams and products. Some of the topics I plan to explore include:

  * How do systems start up, how do they adapt, and how do they fail?
  * What are the qualities of short-lived and long-lasting organizations?
  * What lessons have I learned navigating and shaping different types of organizations?

Since a changelog of this content is available on Github, I may revise and update sections as my perspective changes.
