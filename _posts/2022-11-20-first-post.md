Welcome. This section is an experiment for me to catalog ideas I've developed building teams and products throughout my career. But some of the questions I plan to explore include:

  * How do new systems start,  how do they adapt, and how do they collapse?
  * What are the characteristics of short-lived and long-lasting organizations?
  * What lessons have I learned navigating and shaping different types of organizations?

Since this content is on Github and every change is tracked, I may revise and update sections as my perspective changes.
